# React-Playground
 
Here I will upload my side projects that I will make using the React Framework. Other resources that I will be using will be: 

| Link | Used for |
|:---:|:---:|
| https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html | CSS direct reference | 
| https://material.io/ | UI Design Principles |
| https://nodejs.org/en/ | Backend/Server reference | 

### How to use:
The projects will contain only public and src folders which can be used in your own projects or just for a reference. And for the most part the readme of every single upload will dive deeper
