# React-Playground
 
Here I will upload my side projects that I will do using the React Framework. Other resources that I will be using will be: https://materializecss.com/getting-started.html, https://material.io/, https://nodejs.org/en/. 

### How to use:
The projects will contain only public and src folders which can be used in your own projects or just for a reference. And for the most part the readme of every single upload will dive deeper
